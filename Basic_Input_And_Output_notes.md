# Basic Input and Output

### Exceptions

Many input/output methods can raise exceptions and there are 2 approaches to handling them.

- LBYL - Look before you Leap

  eg. Check an object is not null

- EAFP - Easy to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission

  Go ahead and perform the operation and then respond to an exception is raised.

Trapping and handling exceptions can be done using a try and catch block.
